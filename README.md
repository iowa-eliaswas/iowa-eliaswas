I am an aspiring data scientist in my fourth year at the University of Iowa. 

As a driven data science student, I like solving complex problems through data-driven insights. My approach mixes analytical thinking with a passion for continuous learning. I am always looking for innovative ways to turn data into actionable intelligence. I have a strong foundation in statistics, programming, and business, and I am committed to applying my skills to provide impactful solutions.

Data Science Projects:

1. Election Results Analysis
    - Objective: Visualize and analyze election results to compare voter trends and candidate performance across multiple states.
    - Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

    - Description: Developed a series of interactive visualizations that highlighted key patterns in voter turnout, demographic trends, and vote share differences across states. This project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating insightful graphs for presentation to stakeholders.

2. NYC Flight Data Analysis
    - Objective: Analyze NYC flights data to identify factors contributing to delays and cancellations.
    - Tools Used: R, ggplot2, dplyr, nycflights13 dataset

    - Description: Cleaned and processed flight data, investigating the relationships between weather conditions (e.g., wind speed, precipitation) and delays. Visualized the data through various plot types, such as heatmaps and scatter plots, to effectively communicate findings. This project helped improve understanding of the key variables affecting flight schedules and the impact of weather conditions on air travel.
